# US traffic stops

Data analysis of US traffic stops, using R.

The final group report is available here: [https://hardin47.github.io/TrafficRC2020/Report/](https://hardin47.github.io/TrafficRC2020/Report/). Sections 5.1, 5.2.1, 6.5, and 1.1 were written by me; I also contributed to sections 2 and 3.3.

This repository contains code for reproducing the visualizations from those sections and more.

## Organization of repo

- **literature** contains a collection of articles that I referred to throughout the semester
- **data exploration** contains all of my data analysis, organized in several folders. Each folder contains data visualizations and the RMarkdown files* that were used to create them.
- **logistic regression (paper writing)** contains the progress I have made so far towards turning our data analysis into a paper. 
- **scratch** contains a miscellaneous collection of code and external resources

\*Our research circle relied on a private SQL database to store the traffic stop datasets, so I editted each RMarkdown file to remove the passcode for our private SQL connection.

## About the project

This repository contains my personal contributions to a research project analyzing traffic stop data from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). This research began in spring 2020 through a half-credit course, Data Science Research Circle, offered by Pomona College's math department and supervised by [Professor Jo Hardin](https://github.com/hardin47) and [Professor Sarkis](https://github.com/taroub). Currently, we are currently in the process of refining our logistic regression model to write a paper for summer 2020. More about the research circle can be found through Professor Hardin's repository [here](https://github.com/hardin47/TrafficRC2020).

The final group report is available [here](https://hardin47.github.io/TrafficRC2020/Report/). I  contributed to section 2 (Literature Review) and 3.3 (Nationwide Functions), and I also authored the following sections:
- 5.1 Demographics of Motorists Stopped, Nationwide
- 5.2.1 Stop outcomes from day to night in Oakland, CA
- 6.5 Empirical Search Probabilities Nationwide
- 1.1 Preface
